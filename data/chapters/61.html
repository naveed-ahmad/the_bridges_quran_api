<p class="c17"><span class="c4">1</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth has been highly exalting Allah, and He is the Almighty, the All-Wise. </span><span
        class="c4">2</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;O you who have attained faith, why do you say what you do not do? </span><span
        class="c4">3</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;It is most loathsome to Allah that you</span><span
        class="c0">pl</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;say what you do not do. </span><span class="c4">4</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;Indeed, Allah loves those who combat in His way, lining up in ranks as though they were a compact structure. </span><span
        class="c4">5</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And recall when Moses said to his people, &ldquo;O my people, why do you hurt me, though you know that I am Allah&rsquo;s Messenger to you?&rdquo; And when they swerved, Allah caused their hearts to swerve, for Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people. </span><span
        class="c4">6</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And recall when Jesus, son of Mary, said, &ldquo;O Children of Israel, I am Allah&rsquo;s Messenger to you, confirming what preceded me of the Torah and a bearer of glad tidings of a messenger who comes after me, whose name is Ahmad.&rdquo; Yet when he came to them with evident proofs, they said, &ldquo;This is </span><span
        class="c5">evident sorcery</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt1747" id="ftnt_ref1747">[1747]</a></sup><span
        class="c3">.&rdquo; </span><span class="c4">7</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And who is more unjust than one who fabricated lies against Allah when he was being invited to Islam? Thus Allah does not guide the unjust people. </span><span
        class="c4">8</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;They want to extinguish Allah&rsquo;s Light with their mouths, but Allah shall perfect His Light, even though the deniers hate it. </span><span
        class="c4">9</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;It is He who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth to make it prevail over all religion, even though the pagans hate it. </span><span
        class="c4">10</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;O you who have attained faith, shall I inform you of a bargain that will </span><span
        class="c5">save</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt1748" id="ftnt_ref1748">[1748]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;you from a painful punishment? </span><span
        class="c4">11</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;That you</span><span class="c0">pl</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;believe in Allah and His Messenger, and strive in the way of Allah with your wealth and yourselves; that is better for you, if you only knew&mdash; </span><span
        class="c4">12</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;He will forgive you</span><span class="c0">pl</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;your misdeeds and will enter you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and into beautiful residences in the Gardens of Eden; that is the great triumph. </span><span
        class="c4">13</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And something else you</span><span class="c0">pl</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;love: support from Allah and an imminent conquest. So give glad tidings to the believers. </span><span
        class="c4">14 </span><span class="c3">O you who have attained faith, be </span><span
        class="c5">the supporters</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt1749" id="ftnt_ref1749">[1749]</a></sup><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">of </span><span class="c3">Allah as Jesus, son of Mary, said to the disciples, &ldquo;Who are my supporters towards Allah?&rdquo; The disciples said, &ldquo;We are the supporters of Allah.&rdquo; Then a faction of the Children of Israel attained faith while another faction denied it, and We aided those who had attained faith against their enemy, so they came to prevail.</span>
