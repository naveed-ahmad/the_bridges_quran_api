        class="c4">81</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And they took, apart from Allah, other gods to be a source of might for them. </span><span
        class="c4">82</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;But no! They will deny their worship of them and become opponents against them. </span><span
        class="c4">83</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Have you</span><span class="c0">sg</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;not seen that We have dispatched the devils against the deniers, exciting them with incitement? </span><span
        class="c4">84</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;So do not hurry about them; indeed, We are only counting </span><span
        class="c1">(down)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;for them precisely. </span><span class="c4">85</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;On a day when We herd the ones who were mindful </span><span class="c1">(of God)</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;to the All-Merciful</span><span class="c0">f</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;as a delegation, </span><span class="c4">86</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and flock the criminals into Hell, thirsty, </span><span
        class="c4">87</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;with no power of intercession&mdash;except for the one who had taken with the All-Merciful a covenant. </span><span
        class="c4">88</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And they said, &ldquo;The All-Merciful has taken </span><span
        class="c1">(for himself)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;offspring.&rdquo; </span><span class="c4">89</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;You</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt954" id="ftnt_ref954">[954]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;have</span><span
        class="c0">pl</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;come up with something monstrous! </span><span
        class="c4">90</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;The heavens almost rupture at it, and the earth splits and the mountains fall, crumbling: </span><span
        class="c4">91</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;that they have attributed a son to the All-Merciful! </span><span
        class="c4">92 </span><span class="c3">And in no way is it fitting for the All-Merciful to take </span><span
        class="c1">(for Himself)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;a son. </span><span class="c4">93</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;There is none in the heavens and the earth but is bound to come to the All-Merciful as a servant. </span><span
        class="c4">94</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;He has enumerated them and counted them precisely. </span><span
        class="c4">95</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And each one of them is bound to come to Him on the Day of Resurrection solitary. </span><span
        class="c4">96</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Indeed, those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds&mdash;the All-Merciful will give them love. </span><span
        class="c4">97</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;So indeed, We have made it easy in your</span><span
        class="c0">sg</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;tongue, that you may give glad tidings to the ones who were mindful </span><span class="c1">(of God)</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;and warn with it a hostile people. </span><span class="c4">98</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And how many a generation have We annihilated before them? Can you feel a single one of them or hear from them the slightest whisper?</span>
