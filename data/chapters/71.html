<p class="c17"><span class="c4">1 </span><span class="c3">Indeed, We sent Noah to his people: &ldquo;Warn your people before there comes upon them a painful punishment.&rdquo; </span><span
        class="c4">2</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;He said, &ldquo;O my people, indeed, I am an evident warner to you: </span><span
        class="c4">3</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;that you should worship Allah and be mindful of Him, and obey me. </span><span
        class="c4">4</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;He will then forgive you</span><span class="c0">pl</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;your misdeeds and reprieve you until </span><span class="c1">(you fulfill)</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;a stated term; indeed, Allah&rsquo;s term cannot be deferred once it has come, if you only knew.&rdquo; </span><span
        class="c4">5</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;He said, &ldquo;My Lord, I have called my people night and day, </span><span
        class="c4">6</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;but my call has only made them flee the more. </span><span class="c4">7</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;And indeed, every time I called them, that You may forgive them, they put their fingers into their ears and wrapped themselves in their garments and insisted and became extremely arrogant. </span><span
        class="c4">8 </span><span class="c3">Then I called them openly, </span><span class="c4">9 </span><span
        class="c3">then I spoke to them publicly and I spoke to them privately, </span><span class="c4">10</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;and I said, &lsquo;Ask your Lord for forgiveness&ndash;indeed, He has always been Forgiving. </span><span
        class="c4">11</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;He will send </span><span class="c1">(rain from)</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;the sky upon you</span><span class="c0">pl</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;in showers </span><span
        class="c4">12</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;and supply you with wealth and children and allot for you Gardens </span><span class="c1">(of Paradise)</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;and allot for you rivers. </span><span class="c4">13</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;What is the matter with you</span><span
        class="c0">pl</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;that you do not expect </span><span
        class="c1">(a reward for having)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;reverence towards Allah </span><span
        class="c4">14</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;although He created you in stages? </span><span
        class="c4">15</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Have you</span><span class="c0">pl</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;not seen how Allah has created seven heavens in layers? </span><span
        class="c4">16</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And He has made the moon therein a light, and He has made the sun a lamp. </span><span
        class="c4">17</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And Allah has germinated you</span><span class="c0">pl</span><span
        class="c3">&nbsp;from the </span><span class="c1">(dust of the)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;land, </span><span
        class="c4">18 </span><span class="c3">then He will return you into it and will bring you out again. </span><span
        class="c4">19 </span><span class="c3">And Allah has made the land a spread for you</span><span
        class="c0">pl</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c4">20</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;that you may travel its pathways made broad.&rsquo;&rdquo; </span><span
        class="c4">21</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Noah said, &ldquo;My Lord, indeed, they have disobeyed me and followed one whose wealth and children increased him in nothing but in loss. </span><span
        class="c4">22</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And they schemed outrageous schemes, </span><span
        class="c4">23</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;saying, &lsquo;Do not abandon your</span><span
        class="c0">pl</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;gods, and do not abandon Wadd, nor Souwa&#699;, nor Yaghooth and Ya&#699;ooq and Nasra</span><sup
        class="c0"><a href="#ftnt1801" id="ftnt_ref1801">[1801]</a></sup><span class="c3">. </span><span
        class="c4">24</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And truly, they have misguided many, so do not increase the unjust except in misguidance.&rdquo; </span><span
        class="c4">25</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;For their offenses, they were drowned then hurled into a fire, and they did not find any supporters apart from Allah. </span><span
        class="c4">26</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And Noah said, &ldquo;My Lord, do not leave of the deniers a single dweller in the land. </span><span
        class="c4">27</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Indeed, if You leave them, they will misguide your servants and beget none but wicked relentless deniers. </span><span
        class="c4">28</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;My Lord, forgive me and my parents and anyone who enters my house as a believer, and all the believing men and believing women, and do not increase the unjust except in perdition.&rdquo;</span>
