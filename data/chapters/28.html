        class="c4">20</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And a man came running from the farthest part of the city; he said, &ldquo;O Moses, the chiefs are conspiring to kill you, so get out; I am indeed one of those who seek to advise you.&rdquo; </span><span

        class="c4">22</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And as he headed towards Midian, he said, &ldquo;Hopefully, my Lord will guide me to the right way.&rdquo; </span><span
        class="c4">23</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And when he arrived at the waters of Midian he found there a crowd of people drawing water, and he found two women holding their flocks on the side. He said, &ldquo;What is the matter with you</span><span

        class="c4">24</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;So he drew water for them and then turned away to the shade and said, &ldquo;My Lord, I am in dire need of whatever good you have sent down for me.&rdquo; </span><span
        class="c4">25</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Then one of them came to him, walking bashfully.

        class="c4">29</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;So when Moses had completed the term and journeyed with his family, he noticed a fire by the side of Mount T&ucirc;r. He said to his family, &ldquo;Stay here; I have surely glimpsed a fir</span><span
