        class="c4">20</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And a man came running from the farthest part of the city; he said, &ldquo;O Moses, the chiefs are conspiring to kill you, so get out; I am indeed one of those who seek to advise you.&rdquo; </span><span

        class="c4">23</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And when he arrived at the waters of Midian he found there a crowd of people drawing water, and he found two women holding their flocks on the side. He said, &ldquo;What is the matter with you</span><span

        class="c4">24</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;So he drew water for them and then turned away to the shade and said, &ldquo;My Lord, I am in dire need of whatever good you have sent down for me.&rdquo; </span><span
        class="c4">25</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Then one of them came to him, walking bashfully. She said, &ldquo;My father is calling you to repay you, as a reward for drawing water for us.&rdquo; So when he came to him and narrated to him the narratives, he said, &ldquo;Do not fear; you are </span><span
